"""PyInstaller spec for Nimbus.

Key points:
  - Entry point is ``app.py`` at repo root.
  - Qt binding is PyQt6, not PySide6 — replaced ``collect_data_files``
    target + all hidden-import names.
  - Dropped ``qasync`` (we don't use async-Qt bridge).
  - Added ``anthropic``, ``openai``, ``cartesia``, ``assemblyai``
    explicit hidden imports for SDK dependencies.
  - Output bundle named ``Nimbus`` (so ``dist/Nimbus/Nimbus.exe``).

Build:
    py -3.13 -m PyInstaller nimbus.spec --noconfirm

Output: ``dist/Nimbus/`` containing ``Nimbus.exe`` plus all bundled
DLLs/Python stdlib/site-packages. Inno Setup wraps this folder into
``Nimbus-Windows-Setup.exe`` (see ``installer/nimbus.iss``).

Build tooling installed via pip:
    pip install pyinstaller>=6.20
